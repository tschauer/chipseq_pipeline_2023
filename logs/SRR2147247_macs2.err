# ARGUMENTS LIST:
# name = SRR2147247
# format = BAMPE
# ChIP-seq file = ['Output/BAM/SRR2147247.removeddup.bam']
# control file = None
# effective genome size = 1.87e+09
# band width = 300
# model fold = [5, 50]
# pvalue cutoff for narrow/strong regions = 1.00e-03
# pvalue cutoff for broad/weak regions = 1.00e-03
# qvalue will not be calculated and reported as -1 in the final output.
# The maximum gap between significant sites is assigned as the read length/tag size.
# The minimum length of peaks is assigned as the predicted fragment length "d".
# Larger dataset will be scaled towards smaller dataset.
# Range for calculating regional lambda is: 10000 bps
# Broad region calling is on
# Paired-End mode is on
